# Readstat notes

https://github.com/WizardMac/ReadStat/

- readstat does a first pass to extract the column text entries
- it is not clear how it knows if it has read enough to read ALL column text, I think it just looks at page type
- once column text has been retrieved then all other subheaders and processed immediately, rather than in a second step
